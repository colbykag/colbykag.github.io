## The Importance of Asking Smart Questions
 
Throughout my years of schooling, I have had countless teachers and professors encourage students to ask any question, with some even saying that “there is no such thing as a dumb question.” Those who continue to say this phrase probably have not had their proper dosage of internet forums. Dumb or “not so smart” questions are often frustrating to the one answering the question (if the question even receives an answer). This frustration will likely result in a less than helpful answer, which in turn frustrates the one asking the question. In short, “not so smart” questions are bad for everyone. Therefore, learning to write “smart” questions will not only help the people who answer the questions but also the people who ask them. 

## What is a Smart Question?

In order to avoid asking “not so smart” questions, it would be good to learn what makes up a “smart question.” To do this, we will go through a relatively “smart” question from Stack Overflow, a website for questions and answers regarding coding. In this question, the asker is asking why processing a sorted array is faster than processing an unsorted array. While the question is not as specific as it could be (how is the array being processed), it is specific enough for others to understand what the asker wants to know. The asker states that adding a line of code to sort the array resulted in a much faster execution time, and specifically identifies that line of code to make it easier for others to find. Additionally, the user also creates a version of the code in two different programming languages to show that the behavior is not necessarily language or compiler specific. This demonstrates to others that the person asking the question has put in significant effort to find the solution on their own. 

This question received multiple answers, with one answer even providing a fairly extensive explanation of the reason for the difference in speed. The question was able to generate a lot of insightful discussion among users. 

If you tried doing an internet search on this question, you might notice a number of articles covering this topic. While you might think that this question cannot be a good question if it is this easy to find on the internet, keep in mind that this question was asked over ten years ago. Many of these articles likely did not exist at the time this question was asked. 

## A “not so Smart” Question

While many would think that it would be fairly easy to avoid writing “not so smart” questions, the countless numbers of “not so smart” questions on the internet would suggest otherwise. In this example of a “not so smart” question, the asker starts by asking what is wrong with their code. The initial question says nothing about what the problem is or what the asker is trying to learn. The asker then gives no description of what the purpose of the code is, meaning others will have to read through the code to even figure out what the intended behavior of the code might be. The asker also asks several different questions in their post, which makes it more difficult for someone to answer. Additionally, the asker has not made any apparent effort to learn more about the problem on their own, which makes it seem like the asker just wants someone else to do all the work for them. 

This question received one answer, where the answer essentially just solved the problem for the asker. However, this question also received comments saying that the question was “too broad” and “off topic.” The asker should have specifically described their problem and narrowed it down to one or two specific questions about the problem. The asker should have also put in more effort into trying to debug their own code. 

## Conclusion

Learning to ask “smart” questions is an important skill to learn for any profession, but especially so for software engineers. Anytime we rely on others for help, it is best to make it as easy and convenient as possible for them to avoid wasting their time. While asking “smart” questions may not always lead to the answer you were hoping for, doing so will make a more positive experience for both you and those who try to help you.
